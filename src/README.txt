Experiment 1: Single Sender to Single Receiver Performance Evaluation

    1. Objective

The objective of Experiment 1 is to establish a baseline performance measurement of the network under normal operating conditions, using a single sender transmitting packets to a single receiver over a randomly generated topology.

This experiment allows us to compute three key performance metrics:

Packet Loss Rate

End-to-End Delay

Throughput

These baseline results will later be used for comparison against scenarios involving:

increased error probability

node failures

network congestion

dynamic rerouting

    Results:
